## How do I build one?

1. You will need to get a PCB manufactured. Gerbers are provided which you can send through to your favourite manufacturer. We use Elecrow because they are cheap, fast and do a good job.
2. Accumulate all the compoments. A Bill Of Materials (BOM) is provided as a spreadsheet. The total cost is less than $100.
3. Learn to solder if you don't already know how (YouTube?). Solder all the components, carefully, to the PCB. 
4. Check your soldering and that each component is in the right place. Also check for solder bridges that shouldn't be there.
5. Burn the provided firmware to an Arduino Due using the Arduino IDE or Visual Studio Code.
6. Plug everything together and turn it on! You need to connect a 12V, 1A (or more) power supply to the top PCB for this to work.
